        <h1>Hello and Welcome</h1>
        <h3>
            This sort of looks like a blog post cause it kinda is, its not really a blog post its more like a letter or something not sure how to approach this 
            I definitely want to start this off with a big thank you for even coming this far and reading this right now. It means a lot. <br><br>
            When I started Donutroplis my main goal was about creating some sort of community that could interact with each other and compete for getting 
            rare items or becoming unfathomably rich. I wanted to create something that people could talk about and bond over and that's what I am still working towards right now. <br><br>
            I have definitely faced A LOTTTT of set backs hell it took me more than 6 months to finally get around to actually creating a half decent introduction page but I guess 
            progress is being made? slow or not its still progress. My main goal with these updates is to add much more to Donutroplis to help grow it out and make it stand out from 
            other games that try to do the same idea, by the end of this year I hope to add fully working npcs and much more customization for all the players to utilise.
            <br><br>
            Donutroplis stands out in one way that is much more different than most other games out there, I am transparent as hell. I feel like honesty is a big trait I have with stuff like this 
            I will be straightforward and honest If I am goofing up and I am always open to any sort of criticism cause after all it can all be used to improve. I will admit it Donutroplis is not as 
            flashy or big as most of the other games but Donutroplis has a lot of soul poured into it. <i>I guess a lot of other games have a lot of soul poured into them as well lmao.</i> 
            <br><br>
            Beyond community and social interactions, one of the biggest reasons I started Donutroplis was exclusivity. You ever play this one game and you see some really good skin 
            and you find out its exclusive to a specific time period or specific device like the galaxy skin from fortnite (fastest example I could think of). That feeling of having an item 
            not be available to other people or be really tough to get for other people is great and the fact that you worked hard and managed to obtain it is an even greater feeling. 
            Thats what I wanted to do with Donutroplis, you will find a lot of items that are rare or a little exclusive to get that you can trade or sell for sprinkles and such. Right now 
            I think the rarest item are the golden gloves with 1% chance of being obtained from the highest tier job available so it will prolly sell for a lot of sprinkles.
            <br><br>
            Donutroplis is my biggest passion project EVER. I genuinely never went out this big on any other project before so I hope you feel the passion I poured into it.
            <br><br>
            Anyhow I think thats enough yapping and such I might add another wall of text here later but go ahead and enjoy Donutroplis. Explore it and have fun!!!
